# Container Alerts

## Alert Types

Boxtech contains a series of alerts grouped as:

* Sold
* Scrapped
* Lost
* Stolen

If an alert is active for a container it will be shown on the search results and in the API response for that container.

In all cases Boxtech will continue to show the container details for the container, but in all cases the alert type and text will be provided when active.

### Sold

The container has been sold by the BIC Code Holder and is no longer part of their owned fleet, containers that have been sold should be remarked by the new owner if they are to continue circulation for International movements.

Boxtech will continue to show the container details for the container, but in all cases the alert type and text will be provided.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is possible to make a declaration of sale for containers where you are not the BIC Code Holder for the container. The process is the same as Sold, the container will be shown with an alert to indicate you have made a 'public record of sale', this date of this alert will also be timestamped by Boxtech and viewable by anyone searching for the container.
{% endhint %}

### Scrapped

The container has been scrapped by the BIC Code Holder and is no longer part of their owned fleet, containers that have been scrapped would not normally continue circulation for International movements, the intention is that the container has been or is being disposed of.

Boxtech will continue to show the container details for the container, but in all cases the alert type and text will be provided.

### Lost

The container is flagged as lost by the BIC Code Holder, meaning that whilst it is still in their fleet the whereabouts of the container are currently unknown, anyone finding this container should contact the BIC Code Holder.

### Stolen

The container is flagged as stolen by the BIC Code Holder, meaning that whilst it is still in their fleet the whereabouts of the container are currently unknown, the theft of the container has been reported to authorities and a police report filed. Anyone finding this container should contact the BIC Code Holder and local Police.
