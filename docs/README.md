## User Roles

You can use Boxtech as either:&#x20;

* Consumer&#x20;
* Uploader

#### Consumers&#x20;

As a consumer you get full access to Boxtech to query the containers in the database, you only need the container number you are looking for and you can [search using the web interface](user-guide/search-boxtech.md) for occasional use OR use the [API to integrate](api/api-documentation.md) or script queries to Boxtech from your own application.

You will need to register to gain access, and can start using the application immediately.

#### Uploaders

To [add your containers to boxtech](user-guide/managing-your-fleet.md) and manage your fleet or [apply container alerts](user-guide/container-alerts.md) to containers you will need to have uploader rights.  To qualify for this you will need to register as an uploader in Boxtech and provide the BIC prefix that applies to you.

This information is verified by BIC and once approved you will have the ability to start managing your container fleet and alerts. &#x20;

You will gain immediate access to Boxtech as a `consumer` but only have `uploader` rights until verification has taken place by the BIC team.

When registering for Boxtech provide one of your BIC codes and we will verify your account as part of your application to become an uploader.

If you are already registered as a consumer then, once logged into Boxtech you can request access by clicking the button below and providing a BIC Code.
