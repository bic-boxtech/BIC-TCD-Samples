# Boxtech Dataset

Boxtech stores a number of data elements about a container, the details of which can be found below.

## BIC Code Holder and Current Operator

There are two parties that are often required to be known for a container, and these are the definitions and how they are determined:

### BIC Code Holder

The owner of the BIC Prefix that is marked on the container, this company hold an account with BIC and are the registered code holder. This could be for example a lessor, carrier or shipper with own containers.

### Current Operator

If the container is marked with a BIC prefix belonging to a lessor, they may not be the current operator of the container, as it will likely be 'on hire' to another company. When an `uploader` provides their fleet to Boxtech, if they are not the BIC Code Holder they will become the current operator, when they off hire OR another company on hires and uploads their fleet they will be removed and the new operator added.

## Conversions

### Weights \(kgs/lbs\)

Where the weight of a container is provided in only 1 of the unit types, it will be calculated for the other using the following calculation.

`LBS / 2.20462 = KGS`

`KGS * 2.20462 = LBS`

### Volume \(m3, cuft\)

Where the volume of a container is provided in only 1 of the unit types, it will be calculated for the other using the following calculation.

`CBM * 35.3146667 = CUFT`

`CUFT / 35.3146667 = CBM`
