# Getting Started

Uploading your first container fleet file to Boxtech is a simple process, this guide outlines how to make the first steps using minimum information to become familiar with the process and then moving towards more detailed information and automating the upload from your system if you so choose.

This guide assumes that you have already [registered for Boxtech](https://app.bic-boxtech.org/sign-up), and have been approved as an uploader by BIC.

### Prepare the Upload File

Lets start by preparing our first upload file with some key information that you should have available for your fleet.

1. [Download the template for Fleet In](../../templates/fleet-in-full.csv)
2. Understand the Data Fields
3. Upload to Boxtech&#x20;

Lets look at a basic dataset for our first upload for point 2

| Field                | Description                                  | Example     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| container\_number    | The container number marked as per ISO 6346  | AAAU9999990 |
| detail\_st           | ISO Size Type meeting ISO6346 standard       | 42G1        |
| tare\_kg             | Tare Weight of the Container in Kgs          | 2200        |
| max\_payload\_kg     | Maximum Payload of the Container in Kgs      | 30480       |
| max\_gross\_mass\_kg | Maximum Gross weight of the Container in Kgs | 32680       |

We will use the above data to make our first upload, but please use a container and data relative you one of your own containers.  Add this data to the fleet in template you downloaded in step 1, removing the example record provided.
